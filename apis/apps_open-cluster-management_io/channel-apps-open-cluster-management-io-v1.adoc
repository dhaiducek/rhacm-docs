Description::

--
Channel is the Schema for the channels API
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| ChannelSpec defines the desired state of Channel

| `status`
| `object`
| The most recent observed status of the Channel.

|===
=== .spec
Description::
+
--
ChannelSpec defines the desired state of Channel
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `pathname`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `configMapRef`
| `object`
| Reference to a ConfigMap which contains additional settings for accessing the channel. For example, the `insecureSkipVerify` option for accessing HTTPS endpoints can be set in the ConfigMap to indicate a insecure connection.

| `gates`
| `object`
| Criteria for promoting a Deployable from the sourceNamespaces to Channel.

| `insecureSkipVerify`
| `boolean`
| Skip server TLS certificate verification for Git or Helm channel.

| `pathname`
| `string`
| For a `namespace` channel, pathname is the name of the namespace; For a `helmrepo` or `github` channel, pathname is the remote URL for the channel contents; For a `objectbucket` channel, pathname is the URL and name of the bucket.

| `secretRef`
| `object`
| For a `github` channel or a `helmrepo` channel on github, this can be used to reference a Secret which contains the credentials for authentication, i.e. `user` and `accessToken`. For a `objectbucket` channel, this can be used to reference a Secret which contains the AWS credentials, i.e. `AccessKeyID` and `SecretAccessKey`.

| `sourceNamespaces`
| `array (string)`
| A list of namespace names from which Deployables can be promoted.

| `type`
| `string`
| ChannelType defines types of channel

|===
=== .spec.configMapRef
Description::
+
--
Reference to a ConfigMap which contains additional settings for accessing the channel. For example, the `insecureSkipVerify` option for accessing HTTPS endpoints can be set in the ConfigMap to indicate a insecure connection.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `uid`
| `string`
| UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids

| Property | Type | Description

| `annotations`
| `object (string)`
| The annotations which must present on a Deployable for it to be eligible for promotion.

--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `matchExpressions`
| `array`
| matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| `matchExpressions[]`
| `object`
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| `matchLabels`
| `object (string)`
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

Required::
  - `key`
  - `operator`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `key`
| `string`
| key is the label key that the selector applies to.

| `operator`
| `string`
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| `values`
| `array (string)`
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
