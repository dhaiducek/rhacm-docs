== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| BackupScheduleSpec defines the desired state of BackupSchedule

| `status`
| `object`
| BackupScheduleStatus defines the observed state of BackupSchedule

|===
=== .spec
Description::
+
--
BackupScheduleSpec defines the desired state of BackupSchedule
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `veleroSchedule`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `managedServiceAccountTTL`
| `string`
| Used in combination with the UseManagedServiceAccount property When UseManagedServiceAccount is set to true, defines the TTL for the generated token If not defined and UseManagedServiceAccount is set to true, it defaults to a value using veleroTTL

| `noBackupOnStart`
| `boolean`
| If not defined, the value is set to false. Set this to true if you don't want to have backups created immediately after the velero schedules are created Keep in mind that if you choose not to create ACM backups immediately after the schedules are generated the validation policy will show a violation until backups are generated as defined by the cron job. Also, if backups are not generated immediately, the BackupSchedule will always get into a BackupCollision state during reconcile, if another hub had generated backups to the same storage location. Reconcile will find the ACM backups with newer timestamp and generated by another hub so it will assume another hub currently writes data to the same storage location.

| `useManagedServiceAccount`
| `boolean`
| Set this to true if you want to use the ManagedServiceAccount token to auto connect imported clusters on the restored hub. For this option to work, the user must first enable the managedserviceaccount component on the MultiClusterHub If not defined, the value is set to false. If this option is set to true, the backup controller will create ManagedServiceAccount for each managed cluster connected on the primary hub using the import cluster option see https://github.com/stolostron/managed-serviceaccount#what-is-managed-service-account The token generated by the ManagedServiceAccount will have a TTL defaulted using the backup veleroTTL option When set to false, all ManagedServiceAccounts created by the backup controller are being removed

| `veleroSchedule`
| `string`
| Schedule is a Cron expression defining when to run the Velero Backup

| `veleroTtl`
| `string`
| TTL is a time.Duration-parseable string describing how long the Velero Backup should be retained for. If not specified the maximum default value set by velero is used - 720h

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
