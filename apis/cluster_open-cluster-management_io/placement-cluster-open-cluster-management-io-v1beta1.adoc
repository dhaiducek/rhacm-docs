Description::
+
--
Placement defines a rule to select a set of ManagedClusters from the ManagedClusterSets bound to the placement namespace. 
 Here is how the placement policy combines with other selection methods to determine a matching list of ManagedClusters: 1. Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped ManagedClusters; 2. ManagedClusters are organized into cluster-scoped ManagedClusterSets; 3. ManagedClusterSets are bound to workload namespaces; 4. Namespace-scoped Placements specify a slice of ManagedClusterSets which select a working set of potential ManagedClusters; 5. Then Placements subselect from that working set using label/claim selection. 
 A ManagedCluster will not be selected if no ManagedClusterSet is bound to the placement namespace. A user is able to bind a ManagedClusterSet to a namespace by creating a ManagedClusterSetBinding in that namespace if they have an RBAC rule to CREATE on the virtual subresource of `managedclustersets/bind`. 
 A slice of PlacementDecisions with the label cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name} will be created to represent the ManagedClusters selected by this placement. 
 If a ManagedCluster is selected and added into the PlacementDecisions, other components may apply workload on it; once it is removed from the PlacementDecisions, the workload applied on this ManagedCluster should be evicted accordingly.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
