== ManagedCluster [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
ManagedCluster represents the desired state and current status of a managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster-scoped resource. The name is the cluster UID. 
 The cluster join process is a double opt-in process. See the following join process steps: 
 1. The agent on the managed cluster creates a CSR on the hub with the cluster UID and agent name. 2. The agent on the managed cluster creates a ManagedCluster on the hub. 3. The cluster admin on the hub cluster approves the CSR for the UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster. 4. The cluster admin sets the spec.acceptClient of the ManagedCluster to true. 5. The cluster admin on the managed cluster creates a credential of the kubeconfig for the hub cluster. 
 After the hub cluster creates the cluster namespace, the klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster pushes the credential to the hub cluster to use against the kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster.

== AddOnPlacementScore [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1]

Description::
+
--
AddOnPlacementScore represents a bundle of scores of one managed cluster, which could be used by placement. AddOnPlacementScore is a namespace scoped resource. The namespace of the resource is the cluster namespace.

== ClusterClaim [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1]

Description::
+
--
ClusterClaim represents cluster information that a managed cluster claims ClusterClaims with well known names include, 1. id.k8s.io, it contains a unique identifier for the cluster. 2. clusterset.k8s.io, it contains an identifier that relates the cluster to the ClusterSet in which it belongs. 
 ClusterClaims created on a managed cluster will be collected and saved into the status of the corresponding ManagedCluster on hub.

== ClusterCurator [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1]

Description::
+
--
ClusterCurator is the Schema for the clustercurators API This kind allows for prehook and posthook jobs to be executed prior to Hive provisioning and import of a cluster.

== Placement [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1]

Description::
+
--
Placement defines a rule to select a set of ManagedClusters from the ManagedClusterSets bound to the placement namespace. 
 Here is how the placement policy combines with other selection methods to determine a matching list of ManagedClusters: 1. Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped ManagedClusters; 2. ManagedClusters are organized into cluster-scoped ManagedClusterSets; 3. ManagedClusterSets are bound to workload namespaces; 4. Namespace-scoped Placements specify a slice of ManagedClusterSets which select a working set of potential ManagedClusters; 5. Then Placements subselect from that working set using label/claim selection. 
 A ManagedCluster will not be selected if no ManagedClusterSet is bound to the placement namespace. A user is able to bind a ManagedClusterSet to a namespace by creating a ManagedClusterSetBinding in that namespace if they have an RBAC rule to CREATE on the virtual subresource of `managedclustersets/bind`. 
 A slice of PlacementDecisions with the label cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name} will be created to represent the ManagedClusters selected by this placement. 
 If a ManagedCluster is selected and added into the PlacementDecisions, other components may apply workload on it; once it is removed from the PlacementDecisions, the workload applied on this ManagedCluster should be evicted accordingly.

== PlacementDecision [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1]

Description::
+
--
PlacementDecision indicates a decision from a placement. PlacementDecision must have a cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name} label to reference a certain placement. 
 If a placement has spec.numberOfClusters specified, the total number of decisions contained in the status.decisions of PlacementDecisions must be the same as NumberOfClusters. Otherwise, the total number of decisions must equal the number of ManagedClusters that match the placement requirements. 
 Some of the decisions might be empty when there are not enough ManagedClusters to meet the placement requirements.

Restore is the Schema for the restores API

== ManagedClusterSet [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2]

Description::
+
--
ManagedClusterSet defines a group of ManagedClusters that you can run workloads on. You can define a workload to be deployed on a ManagedClusterSet. See the following options  for the workload: - The workload can run on any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet - The workload cannot run on any ManagedCluster outside the ManagedClusterSet - The service exposed by the workload can be shared in any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet 
 To assign a ManagedCluster to a certain ManagedClusterSet, add a label with the name cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset on the ManagedCluster to refer to the ManagedClusterSet. You are not allowed to add or remove this label on a ManagedCluster unless you have an RBAC rule to CREATE on a virtual subresource of managedclustersets/join. To update this label, you must have the permission on both the old and new ManagedClusterSet.

== ManagedClusterSetBinding [cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2]

Description::
+
--
ManagedClusterSetBinding projects a ManagedClusterSet into a certain namespace. You can create a ManagedClusterSetBinding in a namespace and bind it to a ManagedClusterSet if both have a RBAC rules to CREATE on the virtual subresource of managedclustersets/bind. Workloads that you create in the same namespace can only be distributed to ManagedClusters in ManagedClusterSets that are bound in this namespace by higher-level controllers.
