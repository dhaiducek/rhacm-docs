Description::
+
--
ManagedCluster represents the desired state and current status of a managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster-scoped resource. The name is the cluster UID. 
 The cluster join process is a double opt-in process. See the following join process steps: 
 1. The agent on the managed cluster creates a CSR on the hub with the cluster UID and agent name. 2. The agent on the managed cluster creates a ManagedCluster on the hub. 3. The cluster admin on the hub cluster approves the CSR for the UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster. 4. The cluster admin sets the spec.acceptClient of the ManagedCluster to true. 5. The cluster admin on the managed cluster creates a credential of the kubeconfig for the hub cluster. 
 After the hub cluster creates the cluster namespace, the klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster pushes the credential to the hub cluster to use against the kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster.

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| Spec represents a desired configuration for the agent on the managed cluster.

| `status`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `hubAcceptsClient`
| `boolean`
| hubAcceptsClient represents that hub accepts the joining of Klusterlet agent on the managed cluster with the hub. The default value is false, and can only be set true when the user on hub has an RBAC rule to UPDATE on the virtual subresource of managedclusters/accept. When the value is set true, a namespace whose name is the same as the name of ManagedCluster is created on the hub. This namespace represents the managed cluster, also role/rolebinding is created on the namespace to grant the permision of access from the agent on the managed cluster. When the value is set to false, the namespace representing the managed cluster is deleted.

| `leaseDurationSeconds`
| `integer`
| LeaseDurationSeconds is used to coordinate the lease update time of Klusterlet agents on the managed cluster. If its value is zero, the Klusterlet agent will update its lease every 60 seconds by default

| `managedClusterClientConfigs`
| `array`
| ManagedClusterClientConfigs represents a list of the apiserver address of the managed cluster. If it is empty, the managed cluster has no accessible address for the hub to connect with it.

| `managedClusterClientConfigs[]`
| `object`
| ClientConfig represents the apiserver address of the managed cluster. TODO include credential to connect to managed cluster kube-apiserver

| `taints`
| `array`
| Taints is a property of managed cluster that allow the cluster to be repelled when scheduling. Taints, including 'ManagedClusterUnavailable' and 'ManagedClusterUnreachable', can not be added/removed by agent running on the managed cluster; while it's fine to add/remove other taints from either hub cluser or managed cluster.

| `taints[]`
| `object`
| The managed cluster this Taint is attached to has the "effect" on any placement that does not tolerate the Taint.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present.
