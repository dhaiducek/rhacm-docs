== ManagedCluster [clusterview.open-cluster-management.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
ManagedCluster represents the desired state and current status of managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster scoped resource. The name is the cluster UID.

The cluster join process follows a double opt-in process:

1. Agent on managed cluster creates CSR on hub with cluster UID and agent name. 2. Agent on managed cluster creates ManagedCluster on hub. 3. Cluster admin on hub approves the CSR for UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster. 4. Cluster admin sets spec.acceptClient of ManagedCluster to true. 5. Cluster admin on managed cluster creates credential of kubeconfig to hub.

Once the hub creates the cluster namespace, the Klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster pushes the credential to the hub to use against the kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster.

== ManagedClusterSet [clusterview.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1]

Description::
+
--
ManagedClusterSet defines a group of ManagedClusters that user's workload can run on. A workload can be defined to deployed on a ManagedClusterSet, which mean:
 1. The workload can run on any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet
 2. The workload cannot run on any ManagedCluster outside the ManagedClusterSet
 3. The service exposed by the workload can be shared in any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet

In order to assign a ManagedCluster to a certian ManagedClusterSet, add a label with name `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset` on the ManagedCluster to refers to the ManagedClusterSet. User is not allow to add/remove this label on a ManagedCluster unless they have a RBAC rule to CREATE on a virtual subresource of managedclustersets/join. In order to update this label, user must have the permission on both the old and new ManagedClusterSet.
