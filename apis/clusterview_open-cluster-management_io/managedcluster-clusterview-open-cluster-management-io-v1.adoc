Description::
+
--
ManagedCluster represents the desired state and current status of managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster scoped resource. The name is the cluster UID.

The cluster join process follows a double opt-in process:

1. Agent on managed cluster creates CSR on hub with cluster UID and agent name. 2. Agent on managed cluster creates ManagedCluster on hub. 3. Cluster admin on hub approves the CSR for UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster. 4. Cluster admin sets spec.acceptClient of ManagedCluster to true. 5. Cluster admin on managed cluster creates credential of kubeconfig to hub.

Once the hub creates the cluster namespace, the Klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster pushes the credential to the hub to use against the kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster.

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:[`ObjectMeta_v2`]
| 

| `spec`
| `object`
| ManagedClusterSpec provides the information to securely connect to a remote server and verify its identity.

| `status`
| `object`
| ManagedClusterStatus represents the current status of joined managed cluster.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `hubAcceptsClient`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `hubAcceptsClient`
| `boolean`
| hubAcceptsClient represents that hub accepts the joining of Klusterlet agent on the managed cluster with the hub. The default value is false, and can only be set true when the user on hub has an RBAC rule to UPDATE on the virtual subresource of managedclusters/accept. When the value is set true, a namespace whose name is the same as the name of ManagedCluster is created on the hub. This namespace represents the managed cluster, also role/rolebinding is created on the namespace to grant the permision of access from the agent on the managed cluster. When the value is set to false, the namespace representing the managed cluster is deleted.

| `leaseDurationSeconds`
| `integer`
| LeaseDurationSeconds is used to coordinate the lease update time of Klusterlet agents on the managed cluster. If its value is zero, the Klusterlet agent will update its lease every 60 seconds by default

| `managedClusterClientConfigs`
| `array`
| ManagedClusterClientConfigs represents a list of the apiserver address of the managed cluster. If it is empty, the managed cluster has no accessible address for the hub to connect with it.

| `managedClusterClientConfigs[]`
| `object`
| ClientConfig represents the apiserver address of the managed cluster.

| `taints`
| `array`
| Taints is a property of managed cluster that allow the cluster to be repelled when scheduling. Taints, including 'ManagedClusterUnavailable' and 'ManagedClusterUnreachable', can not be added/removed by agent running on the managed cluster; while it's fine to add/remove other taints from either hub cluser or managed cluster.

| `taints[]`
| `object`
| The managed cluster this Taint is attached to has the "effect" on any placement that does not tolerate the Taint.
