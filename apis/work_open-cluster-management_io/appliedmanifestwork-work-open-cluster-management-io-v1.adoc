Description::
+
--
AppliedManifestWork represents an applied manifestwork on managed cluster that is placed on a managed cluster. An AppliedManifestWork links to a manifestwork on a hub recording resources deployed in the managed cluster. When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster can delete appliedmanifestwork to remove resources deployed by the agent. The name of the appliedmanifestwork must be in the format of {hash of hub's first kube-apiserver url}-{manifestwork name}

  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| Spec represents the desired configuration of AppliedManifestWork.

| `status`
| `object`
| Status represents the current status of AppliedManifestWork.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `agentID`
| `string`
| AgentID represents the ID of the work agent who is to handle this AppliedManifestWork.

| `hubHash`
| `string`
| HubHash represents the hash of the first hub kube apiserver to identify which hub this AppliedManifestWork links to.

| `manifestWorkName`
| `string`
| ManifestWorkName represents the name of the related manifestwork on the hub.

=== .status
Description::

Status represents the current status of AppliedManifestWork.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `appliedResources`
| `array`
| AppliedResources represents a list of resources defined within the manifestwork that are applied. Only resources with valid GroupVersionResource, namespace, and name are suitable. An item in this slice is deleted when there is no mapped manifest in manifestwork.Spec or by finalizer. The resource relating to the item will also be removed from managed cluster. The deleted resource may still be present until the finalizers for that resource are finished. However, the resource will not be undeleted, so it can be removed from this list and eventual consistency is preserved.

| `appliedResources[]`
| `object`
| AppliedManifestResourceMeta represents the group, version, resource, name and namespace of a resource. Since these resources have been created, they must have valid group, version, resource, namespace, and name.

| `evictionStartTime`
| `string`
| EvictionStartTime represents the current appliedmanifestwork will be evicted after a grace period. An appliedmanifestwork will be evicted from the managed cluster in the following two scenarios: - the manifestwork of the current appliedmanifestwork is missing on the hub, or - the appliedmanifestwork hub hash does not match the current hub hash of the work agent.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
