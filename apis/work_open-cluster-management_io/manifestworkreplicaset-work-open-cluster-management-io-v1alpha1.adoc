Description::
+
--
ManifestWorkReplicaSet is the Schema for the ManifestWorkReplicaSet API. This custom resource is able to apply ManifestWork using Placement for 0..n ManagedCluster(in their namespaces). It will also remove the ManifestWork custom resources when deleted. Lastly the specific ManifestWork custom resources created per ManagedCluster namespace will be adjusted based on PlacementDecision changes.

| `maxFailures`
| `integer-or-string`
| MaxFailures is a percentage or number of clusters in the current rollout that can fail before proceeding to the next rollout. Fail means the cluster has a failed status or timeout status (does not reach successful status after ProgressDeadline). Once the MaxFailures is breached, the rollout will stop. MaxFailures is only considered for rollout types Progressive and ProgressivePerGroup. For Progressive, this is considered over the total number of clusters. For ProgressivePerGroup, this is considered according to the size of the current group. For both Progressive and ProgressivePerGroup, the MaxFailures does not apply for MandatoryDecisionGroups, which tolerate no failures. Default is that no failures are tolerated.

In other words, the minimum amount of time the workload applier controller will wait from the start of each rollout before proceeding (assuming a successful state has been reached and MaxFailures wasn't breached). MinSuccessTime is only considered for rollout types Progressive and ProgressivePerGroup. The default value is 0 meaning the workload applier proceeds immediately after a successful state is reached.

|===
| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
